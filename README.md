## Motivation

This interdisciplinary project explores the feasibility and financial implications of replacing Amazon S3 with Cloudflare R2 as an object storage solution. Cloudflare R2 offers a competitive alternative with S3-compatible APIs, eliminating egress costs to the public internet. This project aims to assess whether migrating from AWS S3 to Cloudflare R2 can result in substantial cost savings while maintaining performance and reliability.
