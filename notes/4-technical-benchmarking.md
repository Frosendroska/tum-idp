# Technical Benchmarking

> Simulate real-world workloads to assess performance and stability, gradually increasing a scale.\
Measure latency, request performance, and data retrieval speed across multiple cloud environments.

## Overview
This phase focuses on conducting comprehensive technical benchmarking of AWS S3 and Cloudflare R2 using real-world workload patterns. The goal is to evaluate performance characteristics, stability, and scalability under various conditions and at different scales.

## Key Areas of Benchmarking

   - Recovery testing
   - Consistency checks
   - Availability monitoring

4. Multi-Cloud Environment Testing
   - Cross-region performance
   - Multi-cloud integration
   - Data transfer speeds
   - API compatibility
   - Service interoperability

5. Scalability Analysis
   - Horizontal scaling
   - Vertical scaling
   - Load distribution
