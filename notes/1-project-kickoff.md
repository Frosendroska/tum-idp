Sources: [AWS Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-block-file-object-storage/)

üß± **Block Storage** - Raw storage volumes split into fixed-size blocks. Requires a file system to manage data. Fast and low-latency, ideal for databases and VMs. Minimal built-in metadata.

**Example**: AWS EBS, Google Persistent Disk, local SSDs\

**Best for**: Databases, OS disks, low-latency apps

üóÇÔ∏è **File Storage** - Hierarchical file and folder structure with standard protocols (NFS, SMB). Supports permissions and shared access. Best for traditional applications needing file paths.

**Example**: AWS EFS, Azure Files, Google Filestore, on-prem NAS\

**Best for**: Shared folders, file-based apps

üß∫ **Object Storage** - Stores data as objects with rich metadata and unique IDs. Accessed via HTTP APIs. Highly scalable, great for unstructured data like images and backups.

**Example**: AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Google Cloud Storage, Hetzner Storage Box\

**Best for**: Scalable storage for unstructured data

| **Metadata Management** | Can store unlimited metadata and define custom fields.                         | Uses very little associated metadata.                                                      | Stores limited metadata relevant only to files.                                         |
| **Performance**       | Stores unlimited data with minimal latency.                                     | High-performance, low latency, and rapid data transfer.                                    | Offers high performance for shared file access.                                         |
| **Physical Storage**  | Distributed across multiple storage nodes.                                      | Distributed across SSDs and HDDs.                                                          | On-premises NAS servers or backed by block storage.                                     |
| **Scalability**       | Unlimited scale.                                                                 | Somewhat limited.                                                                          | Somewhat limited.                                                                       |

## Object Storages

Sources: [AWS Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/object-storage/), [CloudFlare Blog](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/cloud/what-is-object-storage/)

Object storage is ideal for massive, scalable, reliable storage of data that's accessed in batches or over APIs.

Each object is stored in a flat structure and includes: 

- **Data** (e.g., an image, video, log file, Parquet file)
- **Unique identifier** (e.g., hash, UUID, ect)
- **Metadata** - optional or system defined (e.g., tags, timestamps, content type)

Each object is stored in a bucket.  

ü™£ **Bucket** - container that holds objects ‚Äî similar to a folder but without hierarchy. They help organize objects by project, user, application, or use case. Access permissions, region settings, and versioning policies can be applied at the bucket level.

1. Object storage is accessed via standard HTTP-based APIs.
2. Metadata plays crutial role for filtering, organizing, and classification of objects.
3. Object storage systems are built to be highly durable and scalable. Objects are stored across multiple servers or data centers using replication or erasure coding => fault tolerance, scalability, built-in versioning.
4. Designed for cost-Efficiency and massive scale. Object storage is typically low-cost and optimized for large volumes of unstructured data.
5. Access is done through an API.

## How It's Used in Practice

1. _Data Lake Storage_

   **Datalake** -  stores raw, unstructured or semi-structured data (like JSON, logs, images, Parquet) at large scale. It's flexible and schema-less, making it ideal for machine learning, exploratory analytics, and storing data in its original form.

   A data lake uses cloud object storage as its foundation because it has virtually unlimited scalability and high durability.

2. _ETL/ELT Pipelines_

   **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)** - data processing workflows used to move data from source systems to move data.

   Object storage is often used as a staging or intermediate layer in ETL/ELT pipelines.

3. _Data Sharing & Interchange_

   Companies and individuals use object storage to share data across teams, regions, or even companies.

4. _Machine Learning & Analytics_

   Machine learning requires object storage because of the scale and cost efficiency. ML teams use object storages for training data, model weights and logs.

5. _Cloud Apps: Static Assets & CDN Origins_

    Web apps use object storage for hosting static websites (HTML/CSS/JS), serving user uploads (images, docs, videos), origin storage for CDNs (Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront).

6. _Backups, Snapshots, Archival_

   Cloud object storage is excellent for long-term data retention. It is cheap, has long retention and immutable by default.

## Amazon S3

### Why is S3 an industry-standard solution?

- ü•á _First mover_: Launched in 2006, pioneered cloud object storage.
- üåê _S3 API became universal_: Most tools and services support it natively.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è _Ecosystem integration_: Deeply connected to AWS (Lambda, CloudFront, Athena, etc.).
- üåç _Global scale_: Backed by Amazon's massive infrastructure.
- ü´Ç _Enterprise trust_: Proven durability, security, and compliance over decades.

### S3 Architecture

    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3d2259e-850f-4d56-b92e-44fa7a8c7826)

- üõ¢Ô∏è Storage Model
  - Data is stored as objects inside buckets.
  - Each object includes:
    - The data itself (binary blob)
    - Metadata (system and user-defined)
    - A unique key (object name)

- üèóÔ∏è Physical Storage
  - Objects are automatically replicated across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within a region.
  - This replication ensures **11 nines (99.999999999%) durability**.
  - Storage hardware is abstracted ‚Äî users never deal directly with disks or servers.

- üó∫Ô∏è Namespace and Structure
  - S3 uses a **flat namespace** ‚Äî "folders" are simulated using object key prefixes (e.g., `photos/2025/04/image.jpg`).
  - There is no real hierarchy like in a traditional file system.

- üåê Access Layer (API)
  - Users and services access objects via the **S3 REST API** or **AWS SDKs**.
  - Supports operations like:
    - `GET`
    - `PUT`
    - `DELETE`
    - `LIST`
    - `COPY`
  - APIs are designed for high concurrency and **strong consistency** (available after the 2020 update).

- üß© Service Integration
  - S3 integrates natively with many AWS services:
    - CloudFront (CDN delivery)
    - Lambda (serverless processing)
    - Athena (SQL over S3)
    - Redshift Spectrum (external tables)
    - EventBridge and SNS (event-driven actions)

- üîê Security
  - Supports:
    - Bucket policies
    - IAM roles/policies
    - Access control lists (ACLs)
    - Object ownership settings
  - Encryption options:
    - **Server-Side Encryption with S3 Managed Keys (SSE-S3)**
    - **Server-Side Encryption with KMS Managed Keys (SSE-KMS)**
    - **Client-Side Encryption**

- üèéÔ∏è Performance Features
  - **Multi-part upload** for large objects.
  - **Byte-range retrieval** for partial downloads.
  - **Transfer Acceleration** for faster uploads via CloudFront edge locations.
  - **Intelligent-Tiering** to automatically move data to cheaper storage classes based on access patterns.

### Companies That Use S3

A lot of companies leverage S3 under the hood of their architectures. 

1. ‚ùÑÔ∏è _Snowflake_
  
   Source: [SIGMOD 2016 "The Snowflake Elastic Data Warehouse"](https://info.snowflake.net/rs/252-RFO-227/images/Snowflake_SIGMOD.pdf)  

   Under the covers, Snowflake stores its data in AWS S3. When you spin up a Snowflake "virtual warehouse," it will pull data from S3 into its own compute/cache tier and then scale compute independently of the storage layer. They proceeded with S3, because it's usability, high availability, and strong durability guarantees are hard to beat.

### Amazon S3 data transfer pricing (April 2025)

Source: [AWS S3 Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/)

 **Egress** - In networking terminology, egress refers to outbound data transfer from a network to another network or an individual server. For cloud providers, this means data that is transferred from one cloud provider's data centers to the public internet, another cloud provider, or to your own infrastructure.
 
Charges apply in the following scenarios:
 
- Data transferred **OUT From Amazon S3 To Internet**.
  First 10 TB / Month	$0.09 per GB
  Next 40 TB / Month	$0.085 per GB
  Next 100 TB / Month	$0.07 per GB
  Greater than 150 TB / Month	$0.05 per GB
  
- Data transferred **from S3 to AWS services in a different region**: For example, accessing S3 data from an EC2 instance in another region.
  From $0.01 per GB to $0.08 per GB

Data transfers are free in these cases:

- Data transferred **out to the internet** for the first 100GB per month, aggregated across all AWS Services and Regions (except China and GovCloud)
- Data transferred **in from the internet**.
- Data transferred **from an Amazon S3 bucket to any AWS service(s) within the same AWS Region as the S3 bucket** (including to a different account in the same AWS Region).

### Companies That Use R2

Several organizations leverage Cloudflare R2 for its performance and cost benefits:

1. üìà **LunarCrush**

     Source: [R2 website](https://workers.cloudflare.com/built-with/projects/lunarcrush)

     Utilizes R2 to scale globally without worrying about traffic surges, infrastructure limits, or surprise egress costs.  Ôøº

     > "No egress fees is a big advantage, as surprise costs from surging traffic can be annoying. As a startup, one has to be careful about surging costs for DDoS or viral traffic, but with Cloudflare, these worries are eliminated. Thanks to Cloudflare, startups don't need to scale up dramatically or set up their own servers. This results in significant cost savings and eliminates the need for their own infrastructure."
   
3. üé® **Canva**
