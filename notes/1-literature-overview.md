## Object-Storage Fundamentals

### Buckets & Objects

> Sources: [AWS Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/object-storage/), [CloudFlare Blog](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/cloud/what-is-object-storage/)

Object storage is ideal for massive, scalable, reliable storage of data that's accessed in batches or over APIs.

Each object is stored in a flat structure and includes: 

- **Data** (e.g., an image, video, log file, Parquet file)
- **Unique identifier** (e.g., hash, UUID, ect)
- **Metadata** - optional or system defined (e.g., tags, timestamps, content type)

Each object is stored in a bucket.  

ü™£ **Bucket** - container that holds objects ‚Äî similar to a folder but without hierarchy. They help organize objects by project, user, application, or use case. Access permissions, region settings, and versioning policies can be applied at the bucket level.


### Metadata & Versioning

Metadata and versioning are separate but complementary features that improve how objects are managed, described, and retained over time in object storage. Together, metadata and versioning contribute to better object traceability and enable policy enforcement.

üè∑Ô∏è **Metadata** is additional information stored alongside an object. It can be:
  - **System metadata**, automatically managed by the storage system (e.g., object size, creation time, MIME type)
  - **User-defined metadata**, custom key-value pairs added by applications or users (e.g., labels, tags, ownership)

Metadata supports tasks like:
  - Indexing and searching
  - Enforcing access policies
  - Organizing data through tags
  - Automating workflows based on attributes

üïì **Versioning** allows multiple historical versions of the same object to coexist. When enabled, each update to an object creates a new version instead of overwriting the old one.

Versioning supports tasks like:
  - Recovery from accidental deletions or overwrites
  - Time-based audits or snapshots
  - Long-term preservation of data changes


### Durability & Availability Guarantees

Durability and availability are foundational concepts that define the reliability of an object storage system.

- üõ°Ô∏è **Durability** measures the likelihood that your data remains intact and uncorrupted over time. It is expressed in terms of "nines" (e.g. 99.999999999%). High durability is achieved by replicating each object across multiple storage nodes, data centers, or even geographic regions. This protects against data loss from disk failures, power outages, or natural disasters. Object storage systems are typically designed so that even if several hardware components fail, no data is lost.

- ‚ö° **Availability** refers to how often your data can be accessed when needed. It is also expressed as a percentage (e.g. 99.99%) and reflects the system's ability to serve read and write operations without downtime. Techniques such as automatic failover, load balancing, and geographically redundant systems help achieve high availability.
  
Most cloud providers publicly commit to minimum durability and availability levels. These are not just marketing numbers ‚Äî they are contractual promises. If the provider fails to meet these guarantees, customers may be entitled to compensation, such as service credits or refunds. This creates a strong incentive for providers to design robust, fault-tolerant systems.


### Consistency Models

Consistency defines the visibility and predictability of data operations in distributed systems.

- **Eventual consistency** means that updates will become visible after some delay (eventually). 
  - Different readers might see different versions of the data for a short time, depending on their location or caching layers. This model favors performance and availability in globally distributed systems but requires developers to design with possible data staleness in mind.

- **Monotonic reads consistency** ensures that once a client reads a particular version of data, it will never see an older version in subsequent reads. 
  - However, it doesn't guarantee that the client will see the latest version immediately.

- **Read-after-write consistency** guarantees that after a client performs a write, that same client will always see the updated value in subsequent reads. 
  - However, other clients may still see stale data for a short period until the update propagates.

- **Causal consistency** ensures that operations that are causally related are seen by all users in the correct order. 
  - Operations that are not causally linked may appear in different orders across clients. This model is stronger than eventual consistency and supports more intuitive user interactions, while still allowing better scalability than strong consistency.

- **Strong consistency** guarantees that once an update operation (like a write or delete) is acknowledged, any subsequent read will immediately reflect that change.
  -  This model makes system behavior intuitive and reliable for developers, as there is no "lag" between writes and reads. However, achieving strong consistency requires a high level of coordination between distributed nodes, which can increase operation latency. According to the CAP theorem, systems may need to sacrifice either availability or tolerance to network partitions. Additionally, implementing strong consistency often involves complex consensus protocols like Paxos or Raft.

Choosing the right consistency model is critical depending on the application's needs: strong consistency simplifies development, while eventual consistency allows greater performance and scalability.


## Real-World Use Cases

> Sources: [Cloudian](https://cloudian.com/blog/ten-use-cases-where-object-storage-really-stands-out/), [Google Cloud Blog](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-object-storage), [Layer Stack](https://www.layerstack.com/blog/7-use-cases-of-object-storage-a-guide-to-the-power-of-object-based-cloud-computing/)

Object storage plays a foundational role in modern data infrastructure. Its scalability, durability, and flexibility make it suitable for a wide range of real-world applications across industries.


### How It's Used In Practice

1. üóÇÔ∏è _Data Lake Storage_

   A **data lake** is a centralized repository that allows organizations to store all their structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data at any scale. It supports a schema-on-read approach, meaning data is stored in its raw form and structured later when read. Common formats include JSON, CSV, logs, images, videos, and columnar formats like Parquet.

   Cloud object storage is ideal for data lakes due to its virtually unlimited scalability, cost efficiency, and strong durability guarantees. It enables organizations to retain raw data for future analytics, machine learning, compliance, or audit purposes.

2. üîÑ _ETL / ELT Pipelines_

   **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** and **ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)** are common data engineering workflows. In these pipelines, object storage is often used as a staging or intermediate layer between source systems and target data warehouses or databases.

   Raw data is first ingested into object storage, where it can be transformed using batch or stream processing tools. In ELT patterns, the transformation happens after loading data into analytics engines like Snowflake or BigQuery. Object storage provides a cost-effective and reliable place to store both raw and intermediate data, supporting repeatable and scalable workflows.

3. üì§ _Data Sharing & Interchange_

   Organizations frequently use object storage to share datasets between internal teams or over organizational boundaries. Because objects are accessed via HTTP(S) and support fine-grained access controls and signed URLs, sharing large files becomes simple, secure, and scalable.

   This is especially important for collaborative research, partner integrations, and API-driven platforms where large data assets need to be distributed reliably.

4. üß† _Machine Learning & Analytics_

   Machine learning workloads benefit greatly from object storage. ML engineers use it to store training datasets, validation sets, model artifacts, checkpoints, and logs. These assets can be large and versioned, and object storage supports both scale and lifecycle management.

   In analytics workflows, object storage serves as the foundation for data lakes and enables query engines (e.g. Presto, Athena, Databricks, BigQuery) to operate directly on data without needing to move it into a database first.

5. üåê _Cloud Applications: Static Assets & CDN Origins_

   Object storage is commonly used by modern web applications to serve **static content** such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, documents, and videos. Many frameworks support direct integration with object storage for asset deployment.

   It is also widely used as an origin source for content delivery networks (CDNs), such as Cloudflare or AWS CloudFront. **CDNs** are globally distributed networks of servers that cache and deliver content from the nearest edge location to the user, significantly improving load times and reducing latency. This setup allows applications to serve content efficiently with low infrastructure overhead. Combined with signed URLs and cache headers, it supports scalable and secure delivery of static assets.

6. üóÉÔ∏è _Backups, Snapshots, and Archival_

   Cloud object storage is well-suited for backup and archival workloads due to its durability, low cost, and support for immutability. Organizations store daily or weekly backups of databases, virtual machines, or file systems using tools like rsync, rclone, or vendor-managed backup systems.

   Lifecycle policies and storage tiers (e.g., infrequent access, cold storage, or deep archive) help automatically transition data based on age or access patterns, minimizing cost while ensuring compliance and recoverability.


## Market Landscape

## Deep Dive: Cloudflare R2

Sources: [Cloudflare R2 documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/), [Cloudflare R2 website](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/developer-platform/products/r2/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

### Why is R2 a Disruptive Alternative to S3?

Source: [Medium](https://y-consulting.medium.com/cloudflare-r2-vs-the-big-3-a-deep-dive-into-cost-and-technical-efficiency-of-cloud-storage-c1644c61a0d3)

- üö´ **Zero Egress Fees**: Unlike traditional cloud providers, Cloudflare R2 eliminates data transfer (egress) fees, making it highly cost-effective for data-intensive applications.
- üîÑ **S3-Compatible API**: R2 supports the S3 API, facilitating seamless migration and integration with existing tools and workflows.
- üåê **Global Edge Network**: Leveraging Cloudflare's extensive global network, R2 ensures low-latency data access worldwide.
- üß© **Integrated Ecosystem**: R2 integrates natively with Cloudflare Workers, enabling serverless compute operations directly on stored data. 
- üìä **Predictable Pricing**: With transparent and straightforward pricing, R2 offers a cost-effective solution without hidden fees.

### Architecture Overview

- üõ¢Ô∏è **Storage Model**:
  - Cloudflare R2 stores data as immutable objects in named buckets. Each object is referenced by a globally unique key and can include optional metadata.
  - Objects are written and read using an S3-compatible API, making it drop-in compatible with tools and services originally built for AWS S3.
  - Object versioning can be enabled at the bucket level to preserve historical versions of content.
  - R2 _abstracts away_ the concept of storage regions. When a write is made, Cloudflare‚Äôs control plane assigns object placement and routing based on **internal** logic rather than user-selected regions.
  - This global abstraction simplifies architecture and improves operational portability.

- üèóÔ∏è **Physical Storage**:
  - R2 does not rely on the global Cloudflare edge network (300+ PoPs) for primary storage. Instead, it uses centralized storage clusters composed of server nodes within one or more co-located data centers (facilities) per logical region.
  - Within each storage cluster, data is erasure-coded and distributed across a set of storage nodes. Erasure coding provides fault tolerance while minimizing overhead compared to full replication.
  - Facilities are interconnected with Cloudflare‚Äôs backbone network for low-latency internal replication, management, and repair operations.
  - The control plane monitors node health and rebalances or heals data as needed when infrastructure degrades.

- üó∫Ô∏è **Namespace and Structure**:
  - R2 implements a flat namespace under each bucket: object keys simulate folder paths but do not form a true directory tree.
  - Buckets are globally scoped and must be uniquely named across all of Cloudflare R2.
  - Bucket configurations can include access control (public/private), versioning settings, and lifecycle rules (e.g. auto-deletion after N days).
  - R2 supports pre-signed URLs for secure time-limited access and integration with authentication systems via Cloudflare Access or Zero Trust.

- üß† **Data Lifecycle and Redundancy**:
  - When an object is uploaded, it is written to a central cluster and erasure-coded into a set of shards.
  - These shards are written across multiple nodes in physically separate racks and drives within the same cluster to protect against local hardware failures.
  - Popular or recently accessed objects may be cached at Cloudflare‚Äôs edge locations (PoPs) to accelerate delivery to global users.
  - R2 does not replicate data between multiple clusters/regions by default, but the system is designed to allow data restoration from encoded shards if necessary.
  - Cloudflare‚Äôs centralized architecture is optimized for simplicity, cost-efficiency, and tight integration with its CDN and serverless platforms (e.g., Workers and Pages).

### Feature Highlights

- üåê **Access Layer (API)**:
  - Provides a **fully S3-compatible API**.
  - Supports standard operations like `PUT`, `GET`, `DELETE`, `LIST`.
  - Integrates with Cloudflare Workers for serverless compute close to storage.

- üß© **Service Integration**:
  - Tight integration with **Cloudflare Workers** for in-flight data processing.
  - Works naturally with **Cloudflare Stream**, **Pages**, and **Zero Trust** for secure delivery.
  - Can serve content directly via **Cloudflare CDN** without egress fees.

### Reference Use Cases

1. üìà **LunarCrush**

     Source: [R2 website](https://workers.cloudflare.com/built-with/projects/lunarcrush)

     Utilizes R2 to scale globally without worrying about traffic surges, infrastructure limits, or surprise egress costs.  Ôøº

     > "No egress fees is a big advantage, as surprise costs from surging traffic can be annoying. As a startup, one has to be careful about surging costs for DDoS or viral traffic, but with Cloudflare, these worries are eliminated. Thanks to Cloudflare, startups don't need to scale up dramatically or set up their own servers. This results in significant cost savings and eliminates the need for their own infrastructure."
