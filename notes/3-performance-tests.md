# Implementation of Performance Tests & Monitoring

> Set up test environments for AWS S3, Cloudflare R2.\
Develop automated testing scripts to evaluate request throughput.\
Identify potential scalability challenges.

## Overview
This phase focuses on establishing a robust testing environment and developing comprehensive performance testing methodologies for both AWS S3 and Cloudflare R2. The goal is to create a standardized framework for evaluating and comparing the performance characteristics of both solutions.
