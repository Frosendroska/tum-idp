### Data Transfer Pricing

**Egress** - In networking terminology, egress refers to outbound data transfer from a network to another network or an individual server. For cloud providers, this means data that is transferred from one cloud provider's data centers to the public internet, another cloud provider, or to your own infrastructure.

Charges apply in the following scenarios:
 
- Data transferred **OUT From Amazon S3 To Internet**:
  - First 10 TB / Month: $0.09 per GB
  - Next 40 TB / Month: $0.085 per GB  
  - Next 100 TB / Month: $0.07 per GB
  - Greater than 150 TB / Month: $0.05 per GB
  
- Data transferred **from S3 to AWS services in a different region**: For example, accessing S3 data from an EC2 instance in another region.
  - From $0.01 per GB to \$0.08 per GB

Data transfers are free in these cases:

- Data transferred **out to the internet** for the first 100GB per month, aggregated across all AWS Services and Regions (except China and GovCloud)
- Data transferred **in from the internet**.
- Data transferred **from an Amazon S3 bucket to any AWS service(s) within the same AWS Region as the S3 bucket** (including to a different account in the same AWS Region).
